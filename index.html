  The brightest and largest object in our night sky, the Moon makes Earth a more livable planet by moderating our home planet's wobble on its axis,
  leading to a relatively stable climate.<br>
  It also causes tides, creating a rhythm that has guided humans for thousands of years. The Moon was likely formed after a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.
  <br>Earth's Moon is the fifth largest of the 200+ moons orbiting planets in our solar system.<br>
  Earth's only natural satellite is simply called "the Moon" because people didn't know other moons existed until Galileo Galilei discovered four moons orbiting Jupiter in 1610.</p>
